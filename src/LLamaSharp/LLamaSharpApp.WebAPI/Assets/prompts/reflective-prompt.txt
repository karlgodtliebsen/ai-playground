Reflective prompts

These prompts are designed to help individuals gain a deeper understanding of themselves, their beliefs, and their actions. 

They are more like encouragement/self-growth prompts based on a topic or personal experience. 

You might be required to give the model a bit of info before getting a desirable response.
