Instruction-based prompts

These are used to give instructions to the model to perform a specific task. 
A good example of such prompts is the use of Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant. 

Sample:


 -"Call mom", 
 -"Play the latest episode from my favorite TV show."
 -"Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request."
