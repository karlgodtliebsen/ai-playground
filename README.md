# ai-playground
The purpose of this repository is to provide a playground for learning about using AI API, specifically OpenAI and other language models, using dotnet. It aims to demonstrate how to integrate and use AI products together with dotnet technologies.
OpenAI dotnet Client



## Inspiration
Inspiration and resources for working with AI products is found from the following:

The official OpenAI documentation provides detailed information about the API reference and other relevant resources. You can find it at:

#### OpenAI API Reference
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/

#### OpenAI Documentation: 
https://platform.openai.com/docs/

#### Azure OpenAI Services:
Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services also provide support for OpenAI. You can explore the overview and documentation of Azure OpenAI Services at:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/getting-started-azure-openai-dotnet/


### GitHub Repositories: 
Several GitHub repositories offer useful code examples, libraries, and resources related to OpenAI and dotnet integration. Here are some repositories worth checking out:

### Configuration

Add appsettings.json (I recommend using user secrets to avoid having the API key in the Repository)

```json
{
    "OpenAIOptions": {
    "ApiKey": "<openai api key>",
    "OrganisationKey": "<organisation key>",
    "OpenAIUri": "https://api.openai.com/v1/"
  }
}
```
